# How to Learn This Project with AI

## Quick Start Method

### Option 1: File-by-File with AI Chat

1. **Open a file** in your editor (e.g., `journal/models.py`)
2. **Copy a section** you want to understand
3. **Ask me (or any AI)**: 
   ```
   "Explain this code line by line: [paste code here]"
   ```
4. **I'll explain** what each line does
5. **Move to next section** and repeat

### Option 2: Ask Specific Questions

Ask me questions like:
- "What does the `AfterTradeEntry` model do?"
- "How does the dashboard view work?"
- "Explain the login authentication flow"
- "What is WhiteNoise and why do we use it?"

### Option 3: Follow the Learning Path

I'll guide you through the project in this order:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Data Structure
```
"Explain the models.py file - what data does this app store?"
```

#### Step 2: Understanding Request Handling
```
"Explain the views.py file - how does the app handle user requests?"
```

#### Step 3: Understanding the User Interface
```
"Explain how the templates work - how is HTML generated?"
```

#### Step 4: Understanding Configuration
```
"Explain the settings.py file - what configurations are needed?"
```

## Best Learning Prompts

### For Any Code Section:
```
"Explain this code section by section: [paste code]"
"What does this function/class do and why is it needed?"
"Walk me through this code step by step"
```

### For Understanding Errors:
```
"I got this error: [paste error]. What does it mean and how to fix it?"
```

### For Understanding Concepts:
```
"Explain Django models/MVT pattern/static files/etc."
```

## Recommended Learning Order

1. **Start**: `README.md` - Understand what the project does
2. **Then**: `journal/models.py` - Understand the data
3. **Next**: `journal/views.py` - Understand the logic
4. **Follow**: `journal/templates/` - Understand the UI
5. **Finally**: `journal_project/settings.py` - Understand configuration

## How to Use This Guide

Just ask me questions! For example:

- "Explain the `AfterTradeEntry` model"
- "How does user registration work?"
- "What does the dashboard view do?"
- "Explain the favicon serving code"
- "How does WhiteNoise work?"

I'll explain any part of the codebase you want to understand!
